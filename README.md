# Ash

Ash (Alex-SHell) is a Unix shell written in Haskell. The idea behind Ash was to learn functional programming concepts and understand how shells work at a deeper level. 
Currently Ash is very barebones, but I hope to add more features soon. 

## Getting Started

Download this repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/AlexanderJDupree/Ash.git
```

Change into the directory and with the Haskell tool [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) installed run:

```bash
cd Ash
stack build
stack exec Ash
```

And done! You should have a very basic shell running in your terminal. 
You can also install Ash with:

```
stack install
```
